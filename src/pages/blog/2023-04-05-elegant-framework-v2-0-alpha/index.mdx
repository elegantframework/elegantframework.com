## New features

### Next.JS

### MDX Loader

### Tailwind CSS

### Jest Unit Testing

### GitHub CI integrations



The first version of Elegant was just a proof of my thesis that a frontend framework could be used to write it's own documenation as we built it.

The first version used Docaurus, which was great for an MVP, but very limited for a complete React frontend.

The release includes

Next.js because it is the way
MDX-JS for loading the docs
Tailwind CSS for the theme

The app is completly responsice, and works on any browser.
The app has full light/dark mode support
The app has a lighthouse score that is already more surperior to wordpress.com
  - The whole hypothesis behind this idea is that the framework can use itself to build all aspects of itself.
  - A janky SEO score on elegantframework.com would translate into a poor seo score within the framework.
