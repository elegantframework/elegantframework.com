The first version of Elegant started life as an experiment. We had a theory that we could build a more simple Wordpress, geared for developers just like ourselves. 

We believed that we could build a beautiful React.js frontend framework, and that it could be used to write it's own documentation as we built it.

Our initial release leveraged Docusaurus for it's markdown feature. While Docusaurus was great for building a minimum viable product, it was very limited in features and extendability.

Some of our most favorite updates from this release are highlighted below.

- [Next.JS:](#next_js) Server-side rendering, static website generation, and much more.
- [MDX Loader:](#mdx_loader) Build all of your content in an easy Markdown format.
- [Tailwind CSS:](#tailwind_css) Beautifully designed, expertly crafted CSS styling.
- [Jest Unit Testing:](#jest) Ensure your JavaScript code runs flawless every time. 
- [GitHub CI integrations:](#github_ci) Automate your deployment from inside your project.

## Next.JS

Next.js is an open-source web development framework providing React-based web applications with server-side rendering and static website generation.
Next.js is one of the top cutting edge technologies leading the way in a JavaScript revolution, so it only made sense for us to use it for this project.

<a name="mdx_loader"></a>

## MDX Loader

MDX Loader is a frontend build utility that lets Elegant seamlessly convert Markdown files inside of your Elegant project into React based pages.

You can write your content pages like this:

```diff-html welcome.mdx
## Markdown is super simple and elegant to write.

Hello? (Hello, hello, hello)
<br>
Is there anybody in there?
<br>
Just nod if you can hear me.
<br>
Is there anyone at home?
```

<a name="tailwind_css"></a>

## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind is an open-source CSS framework .. copy that design token thing

Tailwind CSS allows us to easily create perfectly crafted themes that implement standards and best practices from the internet's leading designers.

<a name="jest"></a>

## Jest Unit Testing

Jest is a JavaScript testing framework created by Meta (Formerly Facebook). It was designed with a focus on simplicity and support for large web applications. 
Elegant comes pre configured straight out of the box with a large number of Jest unit tests. Our goal is to provide 100% test coverage across the Elegant Framework.

## GitHub CI integrations

GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your Elegant deployments. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your Elegant repository.

@TODO: Write sample action yaml

The app is completely responsive, and works on any browser.
The app has full light/dark mode support
The app has a lighthouse score that is already more superior to wordpress.com
  - The whole hypothesis behind this idea is that the framework can use itself to build all aspects of itself.
  - A janky SEO score on elegantframework.com would translate into a poor seo score within the framework.
