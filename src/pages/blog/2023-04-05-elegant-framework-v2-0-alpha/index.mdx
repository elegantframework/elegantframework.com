The first version of Elegant started life as an experiment. We had a theory that we could build a more simple Wordpress, geared for developers just like ourselves. 

We believed that we could build a beautiful React.js frontend framework, and that it could be used to write it's own documentation as we built it.

Our initial release leveraged Docusaurus for it's markdown feature. While Docusaurus was great for building a minimum viable product, it was very limited in features and extendability.

Some of our most favorite updates from this release are highlighted below.

- [Next.JS:](#next_js)
- [MDX Loader:](#mdx_loader)
- [Tailwind CSS:](#tailwind_css)
- [Jest Unit Testing:](#jest)
- [GitHub CI integrations:](#github_ci)

The release includes

Next.js because it is the way
MDX-JS for loading the docs
Tailwind CSS for the theme

The app is completely responsive, and works on any browser.
The app has full light/dark mode support
The app has a lighthouse score that is already more superior to wordpress.com
  - The whole hypothesis behind this idea is that the framework can use itself to build all aspects of itself.
  - A janky SEO score on elegantframework.com would translate into a poor seo score within the framework.
