## React 18

We have upgraded React.js to version 18 in the latest release of Elegant. We wanted to upgrade MDX-Loader to it's latest package version, thus forcing us to upgrade to React 18.

## Node.js 18

Elegant has been upgraded to Node version 18, to support the upgrade to React 18. We have also added additional support for Node.js versions 14 and 16.

## MDX-Loader 2

MDX-Loader has been upgraded to version 2, along with it's dependencies. The latest version allows for even faster Markdown loading and complimation times.

## Discord community

We have launched a new [Discord](https://discord.gg/PwY38x4uvV) community dedicated to the Elegant project. A number of developers have already joined and we would love to see you there as well!
