## Removed .js Files

We have continued to reach our goal of 100% Typescript coverage across the Elegant Framework project by removing .js files or converting them to Typescript.

## Elegant UI

As we have continued to reiterate on Elegant and add features based on user feedback, the core project started to become bloated and complex with basic functional components.

To counter this, we have introduced an NPM package of core functional components called [Elegant UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brandonowens/elegant-ui) that any web application can use.
