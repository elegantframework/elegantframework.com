We have spent the last few months polling developers and reiterating Elegant based on their feedback. <br>

<br>

As a result, we are excited to announce some upcoming changes and features of **Elegant version 3.0**:

- **\_content directory**: Easier, faster, and more simple content loading.

- **Improved markdown support**: Simplified markdown loading, with zero configuration.
