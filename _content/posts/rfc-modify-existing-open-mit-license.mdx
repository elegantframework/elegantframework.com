We are currently seeking feedback and comments from the open-source development community and others on improving our current Open MIT License.

## Goals

- Encourage open extendability of the Elegant Framework.

- Give credit back to Outstatic and other open-source projects used to build Elegant.

- Satisfy all community and OSS expectations and requirements.

## Background

The Elegant project recently came under scrutiny from the open-source software community regarding the current Open MIT License.

We need to give further credit to used open-source libraries and extend compliance to any new application created using the Elegant Framework.

## Proposal

Modify the existing [LICENSE.MD](http://LICENSE.MD) file to include an attribution statement to give proper credit to used libraries.
