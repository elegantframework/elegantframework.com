Horizontal rules give you a way to separate sections of your document visually with a hard line. This guide will show you how to add horizontal rules to your pages.

Below is an example horizontal rule:

<div data-type="horizontalRule"><hr></div>

## Adding Horizontal Rules

Add a horizontal rule to your page by typing a forward slash ‘/’ to trigger a slash command, and then selecting **Horizontal Rule** from the dropdown menu.
