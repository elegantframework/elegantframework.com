## Introduction

A sitemap is a special file that helps search engines like Google understand the structure of a website. It's like a map that shows all the pages on a website and how they're connected to each other.

Having a sitemap.xml file makes it easier for search engines to find and index their pages. This means that when someone searches for something related to your content, your web application is more likely to appear in the search results.
