Enhance your content by adding **Styles** and **Formatting** to your documents.

## Styling Text

Below is a list of included text styling options that you can apply to your content by simply selecting a block of text within the content editor, and then clicking the corresponding styling option within the floating editor menu:

### Bold

Add bold text to draw attention to certain words or phrases within your documents.

> It's important to note that excessive use of italicized text can make reading more difficult, so it's generally best to use it sparingly and with a clear purpose.



### Blockquote

Block quotes are often used to set off a section of text, typically to highlight or draw attention to a specific passage or statement.

Add block quotes to your text to quote others, or even make notes to users within your documentation website.
