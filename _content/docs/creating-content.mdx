Elegant gives you complete control over your content creation experience with an included content editor for creating and editing documents.

The content editor is where you will write content, add images, and links, and even embed YouTube videos.

## Writing Content

You can write content in the Elegant content editor like any other rich text editor. The content editor also supports some markdown syntax, for example, typing `##` when starting a new line will transform it into an H2 heading.

Any text that you write inside the content editor can be modified and styled using the advanced editor menus.
