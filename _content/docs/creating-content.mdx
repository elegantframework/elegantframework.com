Elegant gives you complete control over your content creation experience with an included content editor for creating and editing documents.

## Writing Content

The content editor is where you will write content, add images, and links, and even embed YouTube videos.

You can write text in the Elegant content editor just like any other rich text editor. The content editor also supports some markdown syntax, for example, typing `##` when starting a new line will transform it into an H2 heading.

Any text that you write inside the content editor can be modified and styled using the advanced editor menus.

## Tags

Tags are a great way to group multiple posts while also telling readers what a post is about at first glance with **tags**.

To add tags to your post, click the Tags dropdown and add as many relevant tags to a post as you would like.
