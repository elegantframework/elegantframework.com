Elegant gives you complete control over your content creation experience with an included content editor for creating and editing documents.

The content editor is where you will write content, add images, and links, and even embed YouTube videos.

## Writing Content

You can write content in the Elegant content editor like any other rich text editor. The content editor also supports some markdown syntax, for example, typing `##` when starting a new line will transform it into an H2 heading.

Any text that you write inside the content editor can be modified and styled using the advanced editor menus.

## Editor Menus

There are two main menus used while editing content. The **selection menu** and the **floating menu.**

The selection menu appears whenever you select content within the editor. It helps you turn the current selected word or node into other elements. You can easily add bold, italics, links, etcâ€¦

The floating menu appears on every new line. It allows you to create headings, and add images, code blocks, and quotes.

Images are uploaded to your `/public/images` folder. Elegant fetches the images directly from GitHub so they can be viewed instantly in the editor, even if your website hasn't finished deploying.

## Adding Links

You can add URL links to your documents by simply selecting a block of text, typing in the URL link to an internal or external webpage, and then clicking done.
