Elegant CMS is a free and open-source content management system CMS) for web applications using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Requirements

- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

## Getting Started

To get started with Elegant CMS, simply start Elegantâ€™s local development server using npm:

```ini
npm run dev
```

Once you have started the Elegant development server, your CMS admin panel will be accessible in your web browser at [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin).

\When you navigate to your local CMS admin panel for the first time, you will be prompted to configure authentication before continuing to the content editor.

## Configuring Authentication

Elegant CMS currently uses [GitHub Oauth](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps) for simple and secure user authentication for the admin section of your website.



Before you can access your admin panel, you will need to create a GitHub OAuth app:

1\. Go to the "Register a new OAuth application" page on GitHub by [clicking here](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).
