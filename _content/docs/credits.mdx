We wanted to take the time to give shoutouts and credit to the open-source projects and creators that have been vital in our development of Elegant.

## Thank You ðŸ’œ

## Outstatic

Outstatic is a static CMS editor for Next.js, created byÂ [**Andre Vitorio**](https://twitter.com/andrevitorio).

Elegant CMS is based on [Outstatic](https://github.com/avitorio/outstatic), and uses many of the Outstatic api's internally to power the content editor experience. Andre and the Outstatic community have been amazing and open during our development.

We look forward to continued collaborations, and Elegant will continue to contribute to the Outstatic project as we make advances and discoveries within our project.
