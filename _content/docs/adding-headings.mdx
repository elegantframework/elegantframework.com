Headings can introduce new sections and subsections, break up the text, and automatically populate a table of contents. Headings also help organize and structure your content, making it readable to visitors and search engines.

This guide will show you how to add headings to your documents using the content editor.

## Adding Headings

To add a new **Heading** to your document, start by typing a forward slash ‘/’ to trigger a slash command, and then select either of the **Heading 1**, **Heading 2**, and **Heading 3** options from the dropdown menu.
