Headings can introduce new sections and subsections, break up the text, and automatically populate a table of contents. Headings also help organize and structure your content, making it readable to visitors and search engines.

This guide will show you how to add headings to your documents using the content editor.

## Adding Headings

You can add H1 and H2 heading elements to your document by selecting a text block and clicking either heading button.
