## Upgrading to 3.0 from 2.x

Elegant version 3.0 contains a number of enhancements, features, and fixes in this latest major version.

Included in Elegant version 3.0 is the all-new and free Elegant CMS for creating beautiful documentation, blog posts, articles, and anything else you can think of.

With the introduction of Elegant CMS, there are a few breaking changes to the Elegant core project that include a new \`\_content\` for static content, and simplified Markdown loading.

## Upgrade Guide

For a simple upgrade from Elegant version 2 to version 3, we recommend following the steps listed below.

### Create a Backup

The first step to upgrading to Elegant version 3 is to copy your existing project into another folder for safekeeping.

For example, we used \`[elegantframework.com](http://elegantframework.com) \-- BACKUP COPY\` as the name of our backup copy folder while we upgraded this website to version 3.0.

### Remove Existing Code

After you have created a backup copy of your current Elegant project, go back to the root level of your project directory, select everything, and delete.
