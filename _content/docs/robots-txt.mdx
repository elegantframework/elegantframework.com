A robots.txt file is a simple text file that tells search engine crawlers which parts of your web application they are allowed to access and index.

It's like a set of instructions that says, "Hey, search engines! Here's what you can look at and use, and here's what you should leave alone."

## Introduction

Elegant is configured right out of the box to generate a robots.txt for your web application automatically.

Below is a snippet of our [robots.txt](https://www.elegantframework.com/robots.txt) for this website.

```ini
# *
User-agent: *
Allow: /

# Host
Host: https://www.elegantframework.com

# Sitemaps
Sitemap: https://www.elegantframework.com/sitemap.xml
```



## Development

During local development, a robots.txt file will not generated by your application.

By default, `npm run dev` will not run certain build steps as sitemap and RSS feed generation, and robots.txt creation.

To override this behavior locally, simply run `npm run build` and navigate to your `/public` directory.



## Production

Once you have [deployed](https://www.elegantframework.com/docs/deployment) your Elegant application to your domain, you can view your robots.txt file by navigating to `/robots.txt` at the root of your domain.

For example: [elegantframework.com/robots.txt](https://www.elegantframework.com/robots.txt).
