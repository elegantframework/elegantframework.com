## Adding Images

To add a new **Image** to your document, start by typing a forward slash ‘/’ to trigger a slash command, and then select the Image option from the dropdown menu.

Images are uploaded to your `/public/images` folder. Elegant fetches the images directly from GitHub so they can be viewed instantly in the editor, even if your website hasn't finished deploying.
