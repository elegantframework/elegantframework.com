## Requirements

Before creating your first Elegant application, you should ensure that your local machine has [Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org) installed.

## Installation

The next step is to install the Elegant CLI tool via npm.

```nothing
npm install elegant-cli
```

After you have installed the Elegant CLI tool, you may create a new Elegant documentation project via the NPM `npx elegant-init` command:

```nothing
npx elegant-init
```

## Starting Elegant

After the project has been created, simply start Elegant's local development server using npm:

```nothing
npm run dev
```

Once you have started the Elegant development server, your application will be accessible in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000/docs`.

To stop the Elegant development server, press the `ctrl` and `c` keys together in the terminal:

```nothing
ctrl + c
```
