## Principals

```markdown
- Dont be greedy
    - Create 10x more value than we take.
    - Use our own code to build our products.
    - The users owns the content, not the product or the platform
```

## Mission

Our mission is to empower developers and content creators with a simple and easy-to-use platform; and to give creators the power of big tech by using the most cutting-edge technology.

… todo: explain which tech and why

## How We Got Here

… explain how Wordpress originally launched as a great product; but lost focus as the SaaS cloud generation came around.

… Show their original launch page from wayback machine

…. explain how creators in 2023 need fast and easy to use tech. No legacy databases to manage; No crazy backend server that needs constant security patches applied to avoid a rogue actor filling your website with offensive content.

## Our Plans

… explain how we plan to build out a simple and cheap hosting platform using



We will maintain focus on the ever-changing needs of developers and content creators, as well as the current trends washing through creators everywhere.

## Why Now?

Why couldn't this be done two years ago?

Next.js, Tailwind, React 18 Server Components.

Why not in two years from now?<br>

The market would still be stagnant, and would be riddled with the corpses of CMS startups of the past. I don't think much will have changed in regard to a simple and open content platform;

However I do believe that there will be major adoption of the latest "Serverless Front Cloud" paradigm that was introduced just a few months ago with the introduction of Server Components in React 18.

So why not now?

## Why Did We Build Elegant?

We simply needed a cheap and easy CMS panel to build out documentation and user guides for our startup.
