## Introduction

Rich snippets are a way to provide additional information about a webpage to search engines, like Google, so that they can better understand the content and context of the page. This information can then be displayed in search engine results, making it easier for users to understand what the page is about and whether it's relevant to their search query.

Think of rich snippets as a special kind of metadata that gives search engines a sneak peek at what's on your webpage.

For example, if you have a recipe website, you could use rich snippets to provide information about the ingredients, cooking time, and nutritional value of each recipe. This way, when someone searches for a specific recipe, the search engine can display all this extra information in the search results, making it easier for the user to decide if your recipe is the one they're looking for.
