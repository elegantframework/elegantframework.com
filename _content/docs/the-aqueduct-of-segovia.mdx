The **Aqueduct of Segovia** is one of the greatest surviving monuments of Roman engineering. Built during the time of the emperor Trajan in the first century A.D., it was designed to bring water from the foothills of the Sierra de Guadarrama to the city of Segovia, Spain, some 18 kilometers away.

<br>

The structure is built with over 20,000 rough-hewn granite blocks, held together entirely without cement or clamps. The 278 meter-<br>

long section of the aqueduct that winds through the center of the city has two levels of arches, forming an elegant latticework of stone 34 meters above the city's streets.

After 2,000 years of weathering both natural and man-made calamities, this timeless example of human ingenuity is still in use today providing a supplemental water supply for the city.
