This guide will show you how to use the Elegant text editor menus to create amazing content.



## Editor Menus

There are two main menus used while editing content, the **selection menu** and the **slash command menu.**

The selection menu appears whenever you select content within the editor. It helps you turn the current selected word or node into other elements. You can easily add bold, italics, links, etcâ€¦
